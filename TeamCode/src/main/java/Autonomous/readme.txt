The Autonomous section includes any code dealing with autonomous or automated operations.
Found in this section are a couple of unique files and algorithms, primarily the:
    Cryptobox Detection Algorithm
    Location determination Algorithm
    Glyph Stacking Algorithm
These components all operate to create an effective autonomous OpMode and to help the drivers handle
Jenny throughout the game.
