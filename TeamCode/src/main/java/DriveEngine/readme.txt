This is the "main" part of our robot which handles all driving. The robot uses a Holonomic Drive System
using 4 90 degree offset Omni Wheels. Also found in the drive engine is the base of our Vector Assisted
Location Algorithm. This uses data from the four motor encoders to determine the position of the robot
on the playing field. Other unique functions and algorithms found here include:
    PID Assisted Drive on Heading
    Drive to Location
    PID Assisted Turn to Heading
